### alertify.js - browser dialogs never looked so good

## The end of maintenance... at least for now

Unfortunately, I will no longer be maintaining alertify.js. I have many ongoing projects that aren't leaving me with enough time to do what needs to be done. If anyone wants to create a fork and maintain - by all means go for it!

It's been great seeing people use it and enjoy it and this decision is simply because I don't believe it's fair that developers are looking for help and not getting it.

I wish I had more time or contributions to keep it going and make it better, but the sad reality is that not usually the case on these kinds of projects.

## Why is this repo empty?
Each version of alertify is currently in its own branch and tagged to be used with bower.
* [0.3](https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/tree/0.3) - Latest release 0.3.11
* [0.4](https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/tree/0.4.0-rc1) - (Deprecated)
* [0.5](https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/tree/0.5) - Not yet released
